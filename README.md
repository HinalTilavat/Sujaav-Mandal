```

### Data Flow Implementation

#### 1. User Query Processing
```typescript
// User enters natural language query
const query = "I need a device to help with chronic back pain";

// Query is processed through AI service
const recommendations = await geminiService.getRecommendations(query, PRODUCT_CATALOG);
```

#### 2. AI Prompt Engineering
```typescript
// Custom prompt structure combines user query with product data
const prompt = `
You are an expert product advisor. A user is looking for products and has described their needs as: "${query}"

Here is the available product catalog:
${JSON.stringify(products, null, 2)}

Please analyze and recommend the top 5 most suitable products with:
- Match score (0-100)
- Clear reasoning
- Pros and cons
- JSON formatted response
`;
```

#### 3. Response Processing
```typescript
// Structured response from Gemini API
interface Recommendation {
  product: Product;
  matchScore: number;
  reasoning: string;
  pros: string[];
  cons: string[];
}
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **File-Based Routing Architecture**
- **Choice**: Expo Router with file-based routing similar to Next.js
- **Rationale**: Provides intuitive navigation structure and automatic route generation
- **Implementation**: Tab-based primary navigation with stack navigation for details

### 2. **AI Integration Strategy**
- **Choice**: Google Gemini API with intelligent fallback system
- **Rationale**: Provides sophisticated natural language understanding with graceful degradation
- **Implementation**: Custom service layer with mock recommendations when API unavailable

### 3. **State Management Approach**
- **Choice**: React hooks with AsyncStorage for persistence
- **Rationale**: Lightweight solution appropriate for app complexity without Redux overhead
- **Implementation**: Custom hooks for search and favorites with local storage

### 4. **Component Architecture**
- **Choice**: Modular, reusable components with clear separation of concerns
- **Rationale**: Maintainable codebase with consistent UI patterns
- **Implementation**: Dedicated components for products, recommendations, and loading states

### 5. **Data Structure Design**
- **Choice**: TypeScript interfaces with comprehensive product model
- **Rationale**: Type safety and clear data contracts throughout the application
- **Implementation**: Centralized product catalog with utility functions for manipulation

## File Structure Explanation

### Core Application Files
- **`app/_layout.tsx`**: Root layout with navigation configuration
- **`app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`**: Tab navigation setup with icons and styling
- **`app/product/[id].tsx`**: Dynamic product detail pages with full specifications

### Data Layer
- **`app/data/products.ts`**: Typed product catalog with 51 curated items across 8 categories
- **`app/data/skus.json`**: Raw product data source for easy updates

### Service Layer
- **`app/services/geminiService.ts`**: AI recommendation engine with prompt engineering
- **`app/services/favoritesService.ts`**: Persistent storage for user preferences

### Business Logic
- **`app/hooks/useSearch.ts`**: Search state management and API integration
- **`app/hooks/useFavorites.ts`**: Favorites management with real-time updates
- **`app/utils/searchUtils.ts`**: Product filtering, sorting, and search utilities

### UI Components
- **`components/ProductCard.tsx`**: Reusable product display with favorites integration
- **`components/RecommendationCard.tsx`**: AI recommendation display with scoring
- **`components/LoadingSpinner.tsx`**: Loading states and skeleton screens

## Technical Implementation

### AI Recommendation Engine
```typescript
// Sophisticated prompt engineering for accurate recommendations
const prompt = this.buildPrompt(query, products);
const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}?key=${this.apiKey}`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    contents: [{ parts: [{ text: prompt }] }]
  })
});
```

### Loading States
- **Skeleton Loading**: Smooth loading animations while AI processes requests
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to keyword-based search when AI unavailable
- **Progressive Enhancement**: App works fully without AI, enhanced with AI when available

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load on demand for better performance
- **Memoization**: Expensive calculations cached to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Efficient Filtering**: Optimized search algorithms for real-time filtering
